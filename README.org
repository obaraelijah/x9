* The x9 Programming Language

x9 is a lisp I built to better understand programming languages and interpreters.

The standard library is being written in either x9 or rust for performance.

** Features
*** Usual Lispy Goodness

You have brackets. Lots of brackets. And lists. And functions.

*** Self-documenting

The goal is to have every function describe itself, so you can live in the repl.

Use the =doc= function on a symbol to see it's documentation:

#+begin_example
>>> (print (doc foreach))
Eagerly apply the given function to a sequence or list.
Example:
(foreach
  (fn (x) (println x))
  (range 20)) ; prints 0 to 20. Returns ().

(foreach
  (fn (x) (println x))
  (take 5 (map (fn (x) (* x x x x x x)) (range)))) ; prints 0, 1, 64, 729, 4096
#+end_example

The general goal is to be as helpful as possible. So stacktraces include more
information than you'd usually get, such as arguments.

For example, the following program will fail:

#+begin_src elisp
(defn bottom (x) (% x 2))
(defn middle (x) (bottom x))
(defn top () (middle "a"))
(top)
#+end_src

And give this helpful stacktrace:

#+begin_example
Error: BadTypes

Stacktrace:
  - Remainder requires left and right are num types, was given "a" % 2
  - Error in Fn<%, 2, [ ]>, with args ("a" 2)
  - Error in Fn<bottom, 1, [ x ]>, with args ("a")
  - Error in Fn<middle, 1, [ x ]>, with args ("a")
  - Error in Fn<top, 0, [ ]>, with args ()
